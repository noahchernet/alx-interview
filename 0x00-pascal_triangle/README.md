# Pascal's Triangle

In mathematics, Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial
coefficients that arise in probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra. In
much of the Western world, it is named after the French mathematician Blaise
Pascal, although other mathematicians studied it centuries before him
